/~~~~~~~~~Plan 2016/05/31~~~~~~~~~~/


Not much has been accomplished in the task of coding this project. Only theoretical planning has occured.
This means that various structures for storing the nodes have been considered, ranging from Array, ArrayList, and an Adjacency Matrix.

The core functionality of this project is the creation of an interlinked node system. This will contain at minimum one node, that when interacted
will have either a positive or negative effect on other set nodes. The goal of the interlinked system is to have up to six nodes that each impact
each other in the same manner as listed before. 

The extra functionalities utilize the other data structures discussed in class. There would be two meters that are omnipresent and are culminatively
impacted by the interaction of the nodes. Depending on the levels of these meters, more options will be unlockable. Another functionality would be
a queued series of events that occur in succession such as the collection of taxes or the appointment of elected official.

In order to have any of these extra functionalities, the interface of the project has to be created and involve a working relationship between the two nodes.
The route of development from there is either to add the extra functionalities and test to see how these structures could improve the experience of the 
simulation at this point or to wait until more nodes are available to implement the extra ones.

The tasks need to be delegated in a better manner. Up until this point, there has been a series of disorganization that has plagued us, due primarily for 
procrastination. Jason will be in charge of the implementation of the interlinked node system. This means fleshing out which data structure to choose and 
providing justification as to its utility. Lorenz will be in charge of the simulation element which adds the interesting aspects to the program. Grace will be 
in charge of implementing the extra functionalities, and work with the other two member to ensure that are both attainable as the ideals of the story may 
not be practical with a certain data structure.

Tentative Time Line:

06/01: Complete the two node system. This system will include the ability to interact with one node and impact the other. The extra feature 
would be to allow the nodes to change color, if Processing is utilized. On top of completing this first system, the data structures would need to be fleshed out
even more to ensure that the future objectives to be accomplished effectively.

06/02 - 06/05: Finish a node system that include at least four nodes. On top of that, start to implement the extra functionalities such as the overall meters.
The four nodes will be complicated, which hints at the desired end complexity.
